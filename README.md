# Flapi

Remotely control FL Studio using the MIDI Controller Scripting API

## Setup

TODO: Document this

## Todo

This project is currently not in a functional state. Before the first release I
will.

- [ ] Tidy up code to make it more readable
- [ ] Make it host its own virtual MIDI device (to avoid the need to install
      LoopMIDI)
- [ ] Write documentation
- [ ] Add shell commands
  - [ ] `flapi`: run a Python shell with `flapi` enabled
  - [ ] `flapi install`: install the `Flapi Server` script in FL Studio
  - [ ] `flapi uninstall`: remove the `Flapi Server` script from FL Studio

## Credits

This concept was originally created by
[dimentorium](https://github.com/dimentorium) and is available on GitHub at
[dimentorium/Flappy](https://github.com/dimentorium/Flappy). I have adapted
their code to improve its usability, and make it easier to install.
